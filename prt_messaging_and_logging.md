# Messaging and Monitoring Services

## Messaging and Integration Services

- **Simple Queue Service (SQS):** is a message queue service that allows you to build a **decoupled system**. SQS enables **component-to-component** communication using **messages** where the messages are **processed** **asynchronously**. With decoupled systems or applications, all components can send, store, and receive messages, which helps you improve performance and scalability. SQS is a **FIFO Queue**.

- **Simple Notification Service (SNS):** is a service that allows you to send emails and text messages from your applications. With SNS, you can publish messages on a topic, and subscribers can receive messages. A great example is when CloudWatch detects an anomaly in your infrastructure and sends an email (a plain text email).

- **Simple Email Service (SES):** is an email service that allows you to send richly formatted HTML emails. This services is ideal for marketing campaigns or professional emails. THIS IS THE ONLY MESSAGE SERVICE THAT SENDS RICHLY FORMATTED MESSAGES.
